                Protein: Your dog should be fed high-quality protein that comes
                mainly from meat. Poultry, beef, lamb, fish or eggs are
                excellent sources of protein. Avoid foods in which the main
                source of protein is plant-based ingredients.
              </li>

                Fats: Fats are an important source of energy for your dog.
                Choose healthy fats, such as those contained in fish, vegetable
                oils (such as flaxseed oil or salmon oil), and fats derived from
                meat.

                Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are a source of energy, but should
                not be the main component of your dog's diet. It is recommended
                to choose complex carbohydrates, such as whole-grain cereal
                products (such as brown rice) and vegetables.

                Vegetables and fruits: Adding vegetables and fruits to your
                dog's diet can provide additional vitamins , minerals and fiber.
                Some dogs enjoy eating raw vegetables, such as carrots and
                spinach, but consider boiling or steaming vegetables to make
                them easier to digest.
              </li>

                ></i>
                Supplements: Some dogs may need additional supplements, such as
                glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints, or omega-3 fatty
                acids for healthy skin and coat. However, always consult your
                veterinarian before adding supplements to your dog's diet.
